      "description": "A wave is a disturbance in a medium that carries energy without a net movement of particles. It may take the form of elastic deformation, a variation of pressure, electric or magnetic intensity, electric potential, or temperature. In this course, we will be discussing the stationary waves, sound waves, and doppler effect in detail."
