      "title": "Trignometric Equations",
      "meta_data": {
      "description": "A trigonometric equation is an equation involving one or more trigonometric ratios of unknown angles. It is expressed as ratios of sine(sin), cosine(cos), tangent(tan), cotangent(cot), secant(sec), cosecant(cosec) angles. This course will learn what trigonometric equations are, and we will look through concepts involving trigonometric equations."

      "title": "Inverse Trigonometric Equations",
      "meta_data": {
      "description": "The inverse trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent are used to find angles of any trigonometric function. This course will go through the concept of inverse trigonometry functions, theorems, and graphs."
