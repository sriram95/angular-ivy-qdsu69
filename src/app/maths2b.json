      "description": "Integral calculus is a branch of calculus concerned with the theory and applications of integrals. While Differentiation represents the rate of change of a function, the Integration represents an accumulation or sum of a function over a range. They are somewhat of inverses of each other."

      "description": "A differential equation is an equation that contains one or more terms and the derivatives of one variable (i.e., dependent variable) concerning the other variable. In other words, describing how things change in our world often ends up as a Differential Equation. More precisely, Differential Equations can describe how populations change, how heat moves, how springs vibrate, how radioactive material decays and much more. In this major we will understand what is differential equations, different types of equations and finally Bernoulli's Equation"
