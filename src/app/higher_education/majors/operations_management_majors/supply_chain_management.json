  "description": "<p>The courses and modules that will cover concepts from diverse industries to more and more on their supply chain partners due to globalized complexity, global economies of scale, and the importance of focusing on core competencies. At the same time, supply chains today involve everything and are stretched across continents spanned by road, rail, sea, air, and now, the internet has become increasingly complex. Companies like Walmart, Dell, Toyota, and others have achieved success with efficient and responsive supply-chain-management models. This major will focus on coordinating and integrating various activities into a seamless process while aligning incentives and strategies.</p>",
