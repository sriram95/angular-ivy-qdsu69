      "title": "AI Specialist",
      "meta_data": {
      "description": "Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought-after skills in AI. In this major, we will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. We will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more."

      "title": "Lead Data Scientist",
      "meta_data": {
      "description": "Lead Data Scientist responsibilities include managing the data science team, planning projects and building analytics models. In the previous majors we learnt how to build analytics models. In this major we will learn how to productionize your model on Google Cloud, AWS or any other server. We will be understanding the pickle module and how to save your model. We will learn how to perform project management, how to communicate with your peers and your team and finally you will also learn research methodologies followed by a data science challenge."

  "description": "<p>Data science is a dynamic field thatâ€™s becoming increasingly valuable to many companies, small, large and mid-size. From capturing data to communicating results, data scientists play an important role in helping businesses make strategic decisions and optimize outcomes. Where it traditionally encompassed data mining, programming skills, and analyzing sets of data, data science today is expansive and involves looking at the entire data science life cycle. </p> <p> This skills-based program is intended for learners to have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networks to gain insight into their data. </p> <p> Pre-requisites: Basic Excel, Linear Algebra, Basic Python Programming Language.</p>",
