  "description": "<p> Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event occurs or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates the event's impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. This major will provide you with a basic, intuitive, and practical introduction to Probability Theory. We will learn how to apply Probability Theory in different scenarios and earn a toolbox of methods to deal with uncertainty in your daily life.</p>",
