  "description": "<p>The Internet has only been limited to computers but the evolution in the small electronic devices in a way that they can be connected has led to innovations in many areas. Internet Of Things has found its way from simple home automation to Agriculture to sophisticated cyber-physical systems. Many routine and time-sensitive things are being automated because of IoT technologies. Automation is possible via connecting components like sensors to an IoT device so that the device can operate/enable things to do a specific job. For example, in Agriculture, Moisture sensors are placed in soil to water the crops based on the moisture in the soil.</p>",
